## Common Programming Concepts
### Difference between mut and shadowing

|     | `mut`                                                                                                        | shadowing                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.  | Allows to make a variable mutable, meaning you can change its value after it has been initialised, not type. | Allows to re-declare a variable with the same name in the same scope, effectively *shadowing* the previous variable, new variable can be of different type, mutable/immutable, regardless of original. |
| 2.  | Applies only to the specific variable within its current scope.                                              | Shadowed variable is hidden within the scope the new variable is declared. The previous variable is inaccessible until the shadowing variable goes out of scope.                                       |
| 3.  | You use `mut` when you need to modify the values of a variable multiple times throughout its lifetime.       | You use shadowing when you want to reuse a variable name but with a different type or value, or when you want to apply some transformation without mutating the original variable.                     |
### Data Types
Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

#### Scalar data types
Represents a single value.
1. Integers - numbers without fractional component.
   
| Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
| ------- | ------ | -------- |
| 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit | i128   | u128     |
| arch    | isize  | usize    |

   - Signed numbers are stored using 2's complement representation.
   - Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2<sup>n-1</sup>) to (2<sup>n-1</sup>) - 1 where *n* is the number of bits that variant uses.
   - Each unsigned variant can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1 where *n* is the number of bits that variant uses.
   - Integer Literals in Rust
     

| Number Literals | Example |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Decimal | 98_222 |
| Hex	|0xff|
| Octal	|0o77|
| Binary	|0b1111_0000|
| Byte (u8 only)	|b'A'|

2. Floating-point numbers - numbers with fractional components.

```rust
let x = 2.0; // f64
let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
```

3. Boolean type = 1 byte in size

```rust
let t = true;
let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
```

4. Character type

```rust
let c = 'z';
let z: char = 'Z';  // with explicit type annotation
let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
```

#### Compound Data Types

1. Arrays

```rust
let numbers: [i32; 5] = [1,2,3,4,5];
println!("Numbers Array: {:?}", numbers);

let fruits: [&str; 3] = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
println!("Fruits: {:?}", fruits);
println!("Fruits Array 1st Element: {}", fruits[2]);

/* 
Numbers Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Fruits: ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
Fruits Array 1st Element: Orange
*/
```

2. Tuples

```rust
let human:  (String, i32, bool) = ("Alice".to_string(), 30, false); // "Alice" is a string slice whereas we were expecting String
println!("Human Tuple: {:?}", human);
```

3. Slices

Refer to [The Slice Type](#the-slice-type).

4. Strings

Refer to [The String type](#the-string-type).


### Functions

- an function name/variables should be in snake case
- hoisting is ok in rust, you can create or call functions from anywhere in code.

```rust
fn another_function(x: i32) {     // x is a parameter, special variables that are part of a function's signature; concrete values are arguments.
   println!("the value of _x is {_x}");
}
```

#### Statements and Expressions

##### Statements 

- *Statements* are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- Function definitions are also statements; the given example in its entirety is statement in itself.
- Statements do not return values, hence you canâ€™t assign a let statement to another variable.

```rust
fn main() {
   let x = (let y = 6); // you canâ€™t assign a let statement to another variable
}
```

##### Expressions

- *Expressions* evaluate to a resultant value.
- Calling a function or a macro is an expression; a new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression.
- Expressions do not incluee ending semicolons; if a semicolon is added to an expression it turns into a statement, and then it will not return a value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

#### Function with Return values

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
/**
$ cargo run

Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s

*/
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

/**
$ cargo run

  |

  |    |
  |    implicitly returns `()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression

 * */
```

### Control Flow

#### if statement

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}

```

This is another example of using `if` in a `let` statement

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = 4 > 5;
    let number = if condition { 4 } else { 5 };
    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
// The value of number is: 5
```

Although, this might result in error *`if` and `else` have incompatible types*.

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```

#### Repetition with Loops

1. `loop` - Indefinitely runs a block of code, need explicit exit condition to `break`.
```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```
-  `break` can also be used to return values off `loop`.
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let mut counter = 0;
    
        let result = loop {
            counter += 1;
    
            if counter == 10 {
                break counter * 2;
            }
        };
    
        println!("The result is {result}");
    }
    ```
- `loop` labels can be used to disambiguate between multiple loops.
    - If there are loops within loops, `break` and `continue` apply to the innermost loop at that point.
    - One can optionally specify a *loop label* on a loop that can be used with `break` and `continue` to specify that those keywords apply to the labelled loop instead of the innermost loop.
    - `loop` label must being with a single quote.
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let mut count = 0;
        'counting_up: loop {
            println!("count = {count}");
            let mut remaining = 10;
    
            loop {
                println!("remaining = {remaining}");
                if remaining == 9 {
                    break;
                }
                if count == 2 {
                    break 'counting_up;
                }
                remaining -= 1;
            }
    
            count += 1;
        }
        println!("End count = {count}");
    }
    ```
2. `while`
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```
3. `for`
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

## Understanding Ownership
### What is Ownership
*Ownership* is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory. 
Rust uses an approach where memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. 
If any of the rules are violated, the program won't compile. 

> **The stack and the heap** <br>
> The stack stores value in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order (LIFO). All the data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.
> The heap is less organized. While putting data on the heap: Request a certain amount of space -> memory allocator finds an appropriate empty spot in heap -> marks it as UNDER_USAGE -> returns a pointer for the spot -> perform book-keeping for the next allocation. (*Process is called allocation on heap, or just <u>allocation</u>, pushing values on stack is not considered allocation*). Although pointer to the empty spot of heap has a fixed size and can be stored on stack.
> Pushing to stack is always faster than pushing on heap, as location to push values is always at top of the stack. 
> Data access is also faster in stack than in heap, as location pointer has to be followed to access the value in the latter.
> When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the functionâ€™s local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get popped off the stack.

#### Ownership rules
1. Each value in Rust has an *owner*.
2. There can only be one owner at a time.
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the values will be dropped.

#### Variable scope

```rust
{                      // s is not valid here, itâ€™s not yet declared
    let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

    // do stuff with s
}                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```

##### The String type

- `String` type can be mutated `s2` from below whereas string literal `s` cannot be mutated.

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
let mut s2 = String::from("hello");
s2.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String
println!("{s2}"); // This will print `hello, world!`
```

##### Memory and Allocation

In the above example, `String::from` requests the memory it needs. The memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope.

```rust
{                                   // s is not valid here, itâ€™s not yet declared
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s is valid from this point forward

    // do stuff with s
}                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```

Here, we can return the memory of our `String` when `s` goes out of scope, at which point Rust calls a special function for us which is called `drop` automatically, which cleans up the heap memory for the variable.

> *This pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item's lifetime is sometimes called Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII), especially in C++.*

###### Variables and Data Interacting with Move

Let's take an example,

```rust
let x = 5; // bind 5 to x
let y = x; // make a copy of value in x and bind it to y
```

But what if we used string,

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

You see, `s1` is made up of 3 parts:
1. a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string;
2. length (how much memory in bytes the contents of the `String` are currently using);
3. capacity (total amount of memory in bytes that the `String` has received from the allocator)

These parts are stored on the stack, memory which holds the contents of the string is on the heap.

***When we assign s1 to s2, the String data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to.***

**What if `s1` and `s2` both go out of scope ? Will they both try to free the same memory when `drop` is called ?**

This is called *double free error* which is a memory safety bug, leading to memory corruption.
Rust considers `s1` as no longer valid after line `let s2 = s1;`, meaning the following would result in an error:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;

println!("{s1}, world!");

/**

```

> *Rust does not do shallow copy here, as it also invalidated the first variable, hence it is called a **move**.*<br>
> *We would say `s1` is *moved* to `s2`.* <br>
> *Rust will never automatically create "deep" copies of the data, hence any copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.*

###### Variables and Data Interacting with Clone

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("s1 = {s1}, s2 = {s2}");

```

###### Stack-Only Data: Copy

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;

println!("x = {x}, y = {y}");
```
The above code is still valid.
The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make. That means thereâ€™s no reason we would want to prevent x from being valid after we create the variable y.

Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on types that are stored on the stack, as integers are. If a type implements the `Copy` trait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied, making them still valid after assignment to another variable.

Rust wonâ€™t let us annotate a type with `Copy` if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the `Drop` trait. If the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the `Copy` annotation to that type, weâ€™ll get a compile-time error. 

**What types implement the `Copy` trait**

1. Any group of simple scalar values can implement `Copy`.
2. Nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource can implement `Copy`.
    - All the integer types, such as u32.
    - The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
    - All the floating-point types, such as f64.
    - The character type, char.
    - Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement Copy. For example, (i32, i32) implements Copy, but (i32, String) does not.

##### Ownership and Functions

The mechanics of passing a value to a function are similar to those when assigning a value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{some_string}");
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{some_integer}");
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

##### Return Values and Scope

Returning values can also transfer ownership. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{s2}' is {len}.");
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}
```

### Referencing and Borrowing

The issue with the above code is we have to return the `String` to the calling function so we can still use the `String` after the call to `calculate_length`, because the `String` was moved into `calculate_length`. Instead, we can provide a reference to the `String` value. This action of creating a reference is called *borrowing*.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1); // &s1 refers to s1 but does not own it, hence s1 will not be dropped.

    println!("The length of '{s1}' is {len}.");
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what it refers to, it is not dropped.
```

> The opposite of referencing by using & is dereferencing, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, *. 

<span style="color:orange">We **<u>cannot modify</u>** something we are borrowing.</span> References are immutable just as variables.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}

#### Mutable References

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

Mutable references have one big restriction: <span style="color:orange">If you have a mutable reference to a value, you **<u>cannot have</u>** any other references to that value.</span>


```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s;

println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);

> The above restriction prevents something called a *data race*. A *data race* is similar to race condition, but happens when these 3  occur:

Although, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not simultaneous ones:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

{
    let r1 = &mut s;
} // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

let r2 = &mut s;
```

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s; // no problem

let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

```rust

println!("{r1} and {r2}");
// variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
println!("{r3}");
```

The scopes of the immutable references `r1` and `r2` end after the `println!` where they are last used, which is before the mutable reference `r3` is created; as the scopes don't overlap, this code is allowed.

#### Dangling References

A *dangling pointer* is one that references a location in memory that may be been given to someone else-by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory.
In Rust, this would never happen.

```rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!

TL;DR

- At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.

### The Slice Type

Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.
A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.

```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> ?
```

We don't ownership, so this is fine. But what about return ? *We could return the index of the end of the word, indicated by space.*

```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return i;
        }
    }
    s.len()
}
```

There is a slight problem here. What if we emptied the argument `s` to empty string ?

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s); // word will get the value 5

    s.clear(); // this empties the String, making it equal to ""

    // word still has the value 5 here, but there's no more string that
    // we could meaningfully use the value 5 with. word is now totally invalid!
}
```

#### Solution: String Slices

A string slice is a reference to part of a `String`, and looks like this:

```rust
let s = String::from("hello world");

let hello = &s[0..5]; // string is truncated from start_index to (end_index-1).
let world = &s[6..11]; // start_index can be dropped [..11] and so can the end_index [3..] can also be written as [3..s.len()], and even both of them can be dropped [..]
```

The solution to the above would be:

```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }
    &s[..]
}
```

Now this would not be even valid:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s);

    s.clear(); // error!

    println!("the first word is: {word}");
}

> String literals are immutable and `&str` is an immutable reference.

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {

fn main() {
    let my_string = String::from("hello world");

    // `first_word` works on slices of `String`s, whether partial or whole
    let word = first_word(&my_string[0..6]);
    let word = first_word(&my_string[..]);
    // `first_word` also works on references to `String`s, which are equivalent
    // to whole slices of `String`s
    let word = first_word(&my_string);

    let my_string_literal = "hello world";

    // `first_word` works on slices of string literals, whether partial or whole
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[0..6]);
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[..]);

    // Because string literals *are* string slices already,
    // this works too, without the slice syntax!
    let word = first_word(my_string_literal);
}
```

## Using Structs to Structure Related Data

### Defining and Instantiating Structs

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String, // if we turn the type to &str, we would need lifetime specifier
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: Sring::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sing_in_count: 1,
    }
    user1.email = String:
    
	let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };    
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        active: true,
        username: username,
        email: email,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
    
    // also we can write using field init shorthand
    // User {
    //     active: true,
    //     username,
    //     email,
    //     sign_in_count: 1,
    // }
}

```

#### Tuple Structs

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
```

#### Unit-like structs without any fields

You can also define structs that don't have fields.

> These can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don't have any data that you want to store in the type itself.

```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual; // no need for curly brackets or parentheses
}
```

**Adding Useful Functionality with Derived Traits**

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle{
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    }
    println!("rect is {}", rect1);
}

   |                             ^^^^^ `Rectangle` cannot be formatted with the default formatter
   |
   = help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `Rectangle`
   = note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

```

Hence the outer attribute,

```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // outer attribute
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    /**
     * output
     * rect1 is Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 }
     */
    println!("rect1 is {rect1:?}");
    /**
     * 
     rect1 is Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
     }
     */
    println!("rect1 is {rect1:#?}");
}
```

Another way to print the struct object is:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let scale = 2;
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: dbg!(30 * scale),
        height: 50,
    };

    dbg!(&rect1);
}

[src/main.rs:14:5] &rect1 = Rectangle {

    height: 50,
}

```

### Method Syntax

Methods are similar to functions, but unlike functions methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object), and their first parameter is always `self`, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
    fn width(&self) -> bool {
        self.width > 0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        rect1.area()
    );
    if rect1.width() {
        println!("The rectangle has a nonzero width; it is {}", rect1.width);
    }
}
```

#### Where's the -> operator ?

Rust does not have an equivalent to `->` operator, instead, it have *automatic referencing and dereferencing*.

Both of the following are same.

```rust
p1.distance(&p2);
(&p1).distance(&p2);
```

**More examples on methods**

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };
    let rect2 = Rectangle {
        width: 10,
        height: 40,
    };
    let rect3 = Rectangle {
        width: 60,
        height: 45,
    };

    println!("Can rect1 hold rect2? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
    println!("Can rect1 hold rect3? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect3));
}
```

All the function defined within an `impl` block are called *associated functions*. If the function defined within `impl` block does not have `self` as its first parameter.

We can also have multiple `impl` blocks, no reason why we need to do so, but we can, and it is valid.

```rust 
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };
    let rect2 = Rectangle {
        width: 10,
        height: 40,
    };
    let rect3 = Rectangle {
        width: 60,
        height: 45,
    };

    println!("Can rect1 hold rect2? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
    println!("Can rect1 hold rect3? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect3));
}
```

## Enums and Pattern Matching

*Enumerations* or enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible *variants*. 

### Defining an Enum

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
```

#### Enum Values

```rust
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
```

```rust'
fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}

route(IpAddrKind::V4);
route(IpAddrKind::V6);
```

```rust
struct IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind,
    address: String,
}

let home = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
    address: String::from("127.0.0.1"),
}

let loopback = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
    address: String::from("::1"),
}
```

```rust
struct Ipv4Addr {
    // --snip--
}

struct Ipv6Addr {
    // --snip--
}

enum IpAddr {
    V4(Ipv4Addr),
    V6(Ipv6Addr),
}
```

The given enum `Message` has four variants with different types:

- `Quit` has no data associated with it at all.
- `Move` has name fields, like a struct does.
- `Write` includes a single `String`.
- `ChangeColor` includes three `i32` values.

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move {x: i32, y: i32},
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32,i32,i32),
}

// this is an equivalent structs
struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
struct MoveMessage {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct
```

```rust
impl Message {
    fn call(&self) {
        // method body would be defined here
    }
}

let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));
m.call();
```

### The Option Enum and its Advantages Over Null Values

Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. 

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    None, 
    Some(T),
}
```

The `Option<T>` enum is so useful; you don't need to bring it into scope explicitly. Its variants are also
