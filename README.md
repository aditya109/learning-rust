### Difference between `mut` and shadowing

|     | `mut`                                                                                                        | shadowing                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.  | Allows to make a variable mutable, meaning you can change its value after it has been initialised, not type. | Allows to re-declare a variable with the same name in the same scope, effectively *shadowing* the previous variable, new variable can be of different type, mutable/immutable, regardless of original. |
| 2.  | Applies only to the specific variable within its current scope.                                              | Shadowed variable is hidden within the scope the new variable is declared. The previous variable is inaccessible until the shadowing variable goes out of scope.                                       |
| 3.  | You use `mut` when you need to modify the values of a variable multiple times throughout its lifetime.       | You use shadowing when you want to reuse a variable name but with a different type or value, or when you want to apply some transformation without mutating the original variable.                     |
### Data Types
Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

#### Scalar data types
Represents a single value.
1. Integers - numbers without fractional component.
   
| Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
| ------- | ------ | -------- |
| 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit | i128   | u128     |
| arch    | isize  | usize    |

   - Signed numbers are stored using 2's complement representation.
   - Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2<sup>n-1</sup>) to (2<sup>n-1</sup>) - 1 where *n* is the number of bits that variant uses.
   - Each unsigned variant can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1 where *n* is the number of bits that variant uses.
   - Integer Literals in Rust
     

| Number Literals | Example |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Decimal | 98_222 |
| Hex	|0xff|
| Octal	|0o77|
| Binary	|0b1111_0000|
| Byte (u8 only)	|b'A'|

2. Floating-point numbers - numbers with fractional components.

```rust
let x = 2.0; // f64
let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
```

3. Boolean type = 1 byte in size

```rust
let t = true;
let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
```

4. Character type

```rust
let c = 'z';
let z: char = 'Z';  // with explicit type annotation
let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
```

#### Compound Data Types

1. Arrays

```rust
let numbers: [i32; 5] = [1,2,3,4,5];
println!("Numbers Array: {:?}", numbers);

let fruits: [&str; 3] = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
println!("Fruits: {:?}", fruits);
println!("Fruits Array 1st Element: {}", fruits[2]);

/* 
Numbers Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Fruits: ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
Fruits Array 1st Element: Orange
*/
```

2. Tuples

```rust
let human:  (String, i32, bool) = ("Alice".to_string(), 30, false); // "Alice" is a string slice whereas we were expecting String
println!("Human Tuple: {:?}", human);
```

3. Slices
Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.
A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.

```rust

```

4. Strings

```rust

```

### Functions

- an function name/variables should be in snake case
- hoisting is ok in rust, you can create or call functions from anywhere in code.

```rust
fn another_function(x: i32) {     // x is a parameter, special variables that are part of a function's signature; concrete values are arguments.
   println!("the value of _x is {_x}");
}
```

#### Statements and Expressions

##### Statements 

- *Statements* are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- Function definitions are also statements; the given example in its entirety is statement in itself.
- Statements do not return values, hence you canâ€™t assign a let statement to another variable.

```rust
fn main() {
   let x = (let y = 6); // you canâ€™t assign a let statement to another variable
}
```

##### Expressions

- *Expressions* evaluate to a resultant value.
- Calling a function or a macro is an expression; a new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression.
- Expressions do not incluee ending semicolons; if a semicolon is added to an expression it turns into a statement, and then it will not return a value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

#### Function with Return values

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
/**
$ cargo run

Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s

*/
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

/**

error[E0308]: mismatched types

  |

 * */
```

### Control Flow

#### if statement

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}

```

This is another example of using `if` in a `let` statement

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = 4 > 5;
    let number = if condition { 4 } else { 5 };
    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
// The value of number is: 5
```

Although, this might result in error *`if` and `else` have incompatible types*.

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```

#### Repetition with Loops

1. `loop` - Indefinitely runs a block of code, need explicit exit condition to `break`.
```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```
-  `break` can also be used to return values off `loop`.
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let mut counter = 0;

        let result = loop {
            counter += 1;

            if counter == 10 {
                break counter * 2;
            }
        };

        println!("The result is {result}");
    }
    ```
- `loop` labels can be used to disambiguate between multiple loops.
    - If there are loops within loops, `break` and `continue` apply to the innermost loop at that point.
    - One can optionally specify a *loop label* on a loop that can be used with `break` and `continue` to specify that those keywords apply to the labelled loop instead of the innermost loop.
    - `loop` label must being with a single quote.
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let mut count = 0;
        'counting_up: loop {
            println!("count = {count}");
            let mut remaining = 10;

            loop {
                println!("remaining = {remaining}");
                if remaining == 9 {
                    break;
                }
                if count == 2 {
                    break 'counting_up;
                }
                remaining -= 1;
            }

            count += 1;
        }
        println!("End count = {count}");
    }
    ```
2. `while`
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```
3. `for`
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

## Understanding Ownership

*Ownership* is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory. 
Rust uses an approach where memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. 
If any of the rules are violated, the program won't compile. 

> **The stack and the heap** <br>
> The stack stores value in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order (LIFO). All the data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.
> The heap is less organized. While putting data on the heap: Request a certain amount of space -> memory allocator finds an appropriate empty spot in heap -> marks it as UNDER_USAGE -> returns a pointer for the spot -> perform book-keeping for the next allocation. (*Process is called allocation on heap, or just <u>allocation</u>, pushing values on stack is not considered allocation*). Although pointer to the empty spot of heap has a fixed size and can be stored on stack.
> Pushing to stack is always faster than pushing on heap, as location to push values is always at top of the stack. 
> Data access is also faster in stack than in heap, as location pointer has to be followed to access the value in the latter.
> When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the functionâ€™s local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get popped off the stack.

### Ownership rules
1. Each value in Rust has an *owner*.
2. There can only be one owner at a time.
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the values will be dropped.

### Variable scope

```rust
{                      // s is not valid here, itâ€™s not yet declared
    let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

    // do stuff with s
}                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```

#### The `String` type

- `String` type can be mutated `s2` from below whereas string literal `s` cannot be mutated.

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
let mut s2 = String::from("hello");
s2.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String
println!("{s2}"); // This will print `hello, world!`
```

#### Memory and Allocation

In the above example, `String::from` requests the memory it needs. The memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope.

```rust
{                                   // s is not valid here, itâ€™s not yet declared
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s is valid from this point forward

    // do stuff with s
}                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```

Here, we can return the memory of our `String` when `s` goes out of scope, at which point Rust calls a special function for us which is called `drop` automatically, which cleans up the heap memory for the variable.

> *This pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item's lifetime is sometimes called Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII), especially in C++.*

##### Variables and Data Interacting with Move

Let's take an example,

```rust
let x = 5; // bind 5 to x
let y = x; // make a copy of value in x and bind it to y
```

But what if we used string,

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

You see, `s1` is made up of 3 parts:
1. a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string;
2. length (how much memory in bytes the contents of the `String` are currently using);
3. capacity (total amount of memory in bytes that the `String` has received from the allocator)

These parts are stored on the stack, memory which holds the contents of the string is on the heap.

***When we assign s1 to s2, the String data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to.***

**What if `s1` and `s2` both go out of scope ? Will they both try to free the same memory when `drop` is called ?**

This is called *double free error* which is a memory safety bug, leading to memory corruption.
Rust considers `s1` as no longer valid after line `let s2 = s1;`, meaning the following would result in an error:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;

println!("{s1}, world!");

/**

```

> *Rust does not do shallow copy here, as it also invalidated the first variable, hence it is called a **move**.*<br>
> *We would say `s1` is *moved* to `s2`.* <br>
> *Rust will never automatically create "deep" copies of the data, hence any copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.*

##### Variables and Data Interacting with Clone

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("s1 = {s1}, s2 = {s2}");

```

##### Stack-Only Data: Copy

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;

println!("x = {x}, y = {y}");
```
The above code is still valid.
The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make. That means thereâ€™s no reason we would want to prevent x from being valid after we create the variable y.

Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on types that are stored on the stack, as integers are. If a type implements the `Copy` trait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied, making them still valid after assignment to another variable.

Rust wonâ€™t let us annotate a type with `Copy` if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the `Drop` trait. If the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the `Copy` annotation to that type, weâ€™ll get a compile-time error. 

**What types implement the `Copy` trait**

1. Any group of simple scalar values can implement `Copy`.
2. Nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource can implement `Copy`.
    - All the integer types, such as u32.
    - The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
    - All the floating-point types, such as f64.
    - The character type, char.
    - Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement Copy. For example, (i32, i32) implements Copy, but (i32, String) does not.

#### Ownership and Functions

The mechanics of passing a value to a function are similar to those when assigning a value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{some_string}");
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{some_integer}");
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

#### Return Values and Scope

Returning values can also transfer ownership. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{s2}' is {len}.");
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}
```
