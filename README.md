# Common Programming Concepts
## Difference between `mut` and shadowing

|     | `mut`                                                                                                        | shadowing                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 1.  | Allows to make a variable mutable, meaning you can change its value after it has been initialised, not type. | Allows to re-declare a variable with the same name in the same scope, effectively *shadowing* the previous variable, new variable can be of different type, mutable/immutable, regardless of original. |
| 2.  | Applies only to the specific variable within its current scope.                                              | Shadowed variable is hidden within the scope the new variable is declared. The previous variable is inaccessible until the shadowing variable goes out of scope.                                       |
| 3.  | You use `mut` when you need to modify the values of a variable multiple times throughout its lifetime.       | You use shadowing when you want to reuse a variable name but with a different type or value, or when you want to apply some transformation without mutating the original variable.                     |
## Data Types
Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

### Scalar data types
Represents a single value.
1. Integers - numbers without fractional component.
   
| Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
| ------- | ------ | -------- |
| 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit | i128   | u128     |
| arch    | isize  | usize    |

   - Signed numbers are stored using 2's complement representation.
   - Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2<sup>n-1</sup>) to (2<sup>n-1</sup>) - 1 where *n* is the number of bits that variant uses.
   - Each unsigned variant can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1 where *n* is the number of bits that variant uses.
   - Integer Literals in Rust
     

| Number Literals | Example |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Decimal | 98_222 |
| Hex	|0xff|
| Octal	|0o77|
| Binary	|0b1111_0000|
| Byte (u8 only)	|b'A'|

2. Floating-point numbers - numbers with fractional components.

```rust
let x = 2.0; // f64
let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
```

3. Boolean type = 1 byte in size

```rust
let t = true;
let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
```

4. Character type

```rust
let c = 'z';
let z: char = 'Z';  // with explicit type annotation
let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
```

### Compound Data Types

1. Arrays

```rust
let numbers: [i32; 5] = [1,2,3,4,5];
println!("Numbers Array: {:?}", numbers);

let fruits: [&str; 3] = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
println!("Fruits: {:?}", fruits);
println!("Fruits Array 1st Element: {}", fruits[2]);

/* 
Numbers Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Fruits: ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
Fruits Array 1st Element: Orange
*/
```

2. Tuples

```rust
let human:  (String, i32, bool) = ("Alice".to_string(), 30, false); // "Alice" is a string slice whereas we were expecting String
println!("Human Tuple: {:?}", human);
```

3. Slices
Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.
A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.

```rust

```

4. Strings

```rust

```

## Functions

```rust
fn another_function(x: i32) {     // x is a parameter, special variables that are part of a function's signature; concrete values are arguments.
   println!("the value of _x is {_x}");
}
```

### Statements and Expressions

#### Statements 

- *Statements* are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- Function definitions are also statements; the given example in its entirety is statement in itself.
- Statements do not return values, hence you canâ€™t assign a let statement to another variable.

```rust
fn main() {
   let x = (let y = 6); // you canâ€™t assign a let statement to another variable
}
```

#### Expressions

- *Expressions* evaluate to a resultant value.
- Calling a function or a macro is an expression; a new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression.
- Expressions do not incluee ending semicolons; if a semicolon is added to an expression it turns into a statement, and then it will not return a value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

### Function with Return values

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
/**
$ cargo run

Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s

The value of x is: 5
*/
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

/**
$ cargo run

```

## Control Flow

### if statement

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}

```
